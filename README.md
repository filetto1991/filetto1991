### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Filippo Maestri

I am a 31-year-old guy from Italy. I am a graduate of the hospitality institute(italian high school), and I have several years of experience in the restaurant and hospitality field. My greatest passions are traveling and learning new things. Combining the two, I have worked in London and Spain, where I also could learn English and Spanish at a high level. I have always liked computers, data and statistics to understand how the world is going. I studied on start2impact, where I had the opportunity to work with real projects and get feedback from established professionals in data science and data analysis. My goal is, through data, to make my contribution in shaping an increasingly informed and conscientious society.
