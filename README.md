## 🚀 About Me
I’m Filippo Maestri (Il Gatto), a **Cybersecurity Analyst & Penetration Tester** (eWPTv2, eJPTv2) dedicated to automating the hunt for critical vulnerabilities.

My focus is on bridging the gap between manual pentesting and automated scanning. I specialize in **API Security**, developing tools that go beyond simple signature matching to understand application logic.

### 🛠️ Featured Work
*   🛡️ **[auth-bifrost](https://github.com/filetto1991/auth-bifrost)**: My latest project. An automated engine to detect **Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA/IDOR)** using dual-context replay (Victim vs. Attacker) and heuristic response analysis.
*   🔍 **Reconnaissance Suite**: Modular tools for efficient enum including `subdomain_scanner` and `web_content_discovery`.
*   📊 **Anomaly Detection**: leveraging Python/Pandas for log analysis and threat hunting.

**Core Tech Stack:** Python (Asyncio, Requests), Docker, Linux, Bash.

Always building, always learning. Check out my repositories and feel free to contribute!
