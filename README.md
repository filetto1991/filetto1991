## 🚀 About Me

I’m Filippo Maestri (filetto1991) — a certified Cybersecurity Analyst and Penetration Tester with a passion for building open-source security tools.

I hold certifications such as eWPTv2 and eJPTv2, and specialize in:

⚙️ Web & infrastructure pentesting (Burp Suite, Nmap, SSRF, IDOR, JWT issues …)

🧰 Tool development in Python (asyncio, pwntools, requests) and Bash scripting

⚙️ Linux/Docker environments, container hardening, Kali/Parrot setup

📊 Data analysis and anomaly detection with tools like Python/Pandas

My GitHub features modular, high-quality projects including:

subdomain_scanner – multi-record DNS subdomain enum

brute_forcer – fast HTTP login brute force utility

I create reliable, efficient, educational tooling to help the InfoSec community grow and learn together. I believe in open collaboration—feedback, contributions, and discussions are always welcome!
